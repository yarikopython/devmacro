# DevMacro by Yarikopython/Darkness

**DevMacro** is an advanced AFK macro tool created by **Yarikopython/Darkness** for automating tasks in games like **Sols RNG** on Roblox. This macro allows players to remain AFK while tracking progress on quests, aura storage, and item inventory, sending regular updates to a specified Discord channel through a webhook.

This script uses both **Python** and **AutoHotkey (AHK)** to handle different automation tasks. Python powers the core functionalities, including GUI, Discord integration, and data tracking, while AutoHotkey is used for certain low-level automation features, like managing input controls in the game.

## ðŸ“œ Features
- **Stay AFK**: Keeps your character active to avoid disconnection.
- **Quest, Aura, and Inventory Tracking**: Monitors in-game progress, aura levels, and inventory in real time.
- **Discord Webhook Notifications**: Sends updates to your chosen Discord channel.
- **Customizable Settings**: Enter your user ID, webhook URL, and VIP status for a personalized experience.
